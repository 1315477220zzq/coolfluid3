  /// @brief This class is a dialog that asks important questions to the user
  /// before he closes the application.

  /// The aim of this class is to preserve user's work from loss of data. When
  /// user closes the application, the class is called if some elements request
  /// his attention. He is requested to solve all the "problems" before the
  /// application closes. The dialog guarantees that it will not be closeable
  /// before user answers to all questions. @n @n

  /// After calling the constructor, the dialog is invisible. The @c #show
  /// method has to be called to show it. This is a blocking method: it will
  /// not return until is invisible again. This method returns @c true
  /// if user clicked on "OK" to validate his entry or @c false if
  /// he clicked on "Cancel" or closed the dialog to cancel his entry. @n @n

  /// Calling @c #show method directly after the constructor will do nothing
  /// and directly return @c true. This is because no confirmation panel has
  /// been set. Each confirmation panel asks one question and checks user's
  /// entry, independantly of other m_panels. To work, this dialog needs at
  /// least one panel and at most one panel of each available type.
  /// Avaiblable types are defined @c #CloseConfirmationType enum. Panels can
  /// be set by calling @c #addConfirmation method before callig @c #show.

  /// If the user validates his entry, gathered information are stored in
  /// the @c #CloseConfirmationInfos structure parameter. If the user cancels
  /// his entry, the structure is not modified. @n @n

  /// A typical use of this class is (assuming that @c this is a @c QMainWindow
  /// object) : @n
  /// @code
  /// CloseConfirmationDialog dialog(this);
  /// CloseConfirmationInfos infos;    // used to store gathered information
  ///
  /// dialog.addConfirmation(CLOSE_COMMIT);
  ///
  /// if(dialog.show(infos)            // show advanced connection dialog
  /// {                                // if user clicked on "OK"
  ///  // some treatements
  /// }
