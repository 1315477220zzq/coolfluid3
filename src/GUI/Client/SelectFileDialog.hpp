  /// @brief Open/Save file dialog.

  /// This class subclasses @c QFileDialog. It allows to select a file to open
  /// or to save. The main feature it adds to the base class is the file
  /// extension management. It will not allow user to select a file that does
  /// not have the expected extension. @n @n

  /// The dialog is modal, wich means that once it is visible, the calling code
  /// execution is stopped until the dialog is invisible again. If the dialog
  /// has a parent window, it is centered on this parent. Otherwise, it is
  /// centered on the screen.@n @n

  /// The class possesses two modes (inherited from the base class) :
  /// @c QFileDialog::AcceptOpen (for a "Open file" dialog) and
  /// @c QFileDialog::AcceptSave (for a "Save file" dialog). In @e open mode,
  /// user can not select a file that does not exist. In @e save mode, user
  /// can select a file that already exist, but he has to confirm that he is
  /// aware of overwriting this file. @n @n

  /// The class possesses its own extensions management, allowing the calling
  /// code to specify the available file types and extensions, as the base class
  /// does, but it also garantees that only a file name with the extension
  /// specified by the selected type will be returned. @n @n

  /// After calling the constructor, the dialog is invisible. The @c show
  /// method has to be called to show it. This is a blocking method: it will
  /// not return until the dialog is invisible again. This method returns
  /// either the name (with path) of the selected file (if user clicked on
  /// "OK" to validate his selection) or an null string (if user clicked on
  /// "Cancel" or closed the dialog to cancel his selection), built with default
  /// constructeur.@n @n

  /// The extension management system consists of two parts : the file type
  /// (i.e. : "application", "text", "source",...) and the file extension.
  /// The resulting string will be: @code <type> files (*.<extension>) @endcode
  /// One type may have more than one extension, the resulting string will be
  /// then: @code
  /// <type> files (*.<extension_1> *.<extension_2> ... *.<extension_n>)
  /// @endcode
  /// The file types and extensions must be set before calling @c show. New ones
  /// can be set between two consecutive calls to @c show on the same object.

  /// A typical use of this class to select a file where to save data is
  /// (assuming that @c this is a @c QWidget object): @n @n
  /// @code
  /// SelectFileDialog dialog(this);
  /// QString filename;
  ///
  /// dialog.addFileType("CFcase", "CFcase");
  /// dialog.addFileType("XML", "xml");
  /// dialog.addFileType("Web", "html htm css js");
  ///
  /// filename = dialog.show(QFileDialog::AcceptSave);
  ///
  /// if(!name.isNull())
  /// {
  ///  // open the file
  /// }
  /// @endcode
  /// In the above code, if user selects "CFcase" @c show method will always
  /// return a file name with "CFcase" extension. This is to garantee that
  /// file extension and file type are always compatible.

  /// @warning <ul>
  /// <li> Do not call base class method @c exec() to show the dialog or
  /// the file extension management will not work properly.
  /// <li> Never use the following base class methods: <ul>
  /// <li> <code>setAcceptMode(AcceptMode mode)</code>
  /// <li> <code>setConfirmOverwrite(bool enabled)</code>
  /// <li> <code>setNameFilter(const QString & filter)</code>@n @n
  /// The modifications they do on the object will be overwritten when
  /// calling @c show method.
  /// </ul></ul>@n @n
